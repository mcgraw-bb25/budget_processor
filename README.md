## Python vs VBA/BASIC for Corporate Budget Processing

Within the world of financial services and to a (slightly) lesser extent corporate finance the toolkit of Excel + VBA continues to reign supreme.  Colleagues of mine still use VBA for data processing and computation, and I wanted to compare the usage of Python and VBA.

It's worth noting a few things.  First, and perhaps foremost, I am not using VBA but rather BASIC, which is the scripting language for OpenOffice/LibreOffice.  It's documentation isn't as complete as one might hope, but there are some helpful guides around the web.  Additionally, my skill in Python likely exceeds my skill in BASIC, so there are likely inefficiencies in my BASIC code for which I apologize.
